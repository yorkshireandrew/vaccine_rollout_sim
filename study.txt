    Case detections in England increased from 26,259 in week 38 to 29,797 in week 39
    
    
    Through the GP swabbing scheme, positivity remained stable at 1.7% in week 39
    
    383K tested positive. 7.5%
    
    case vs age shows strong bias towards lower age group 16000 (20-29), 4000 (60-69)
    although there are probably less older people in the population. that needs considering.
    This inplies a strong likelyhood of people mingling mainly with their own age group.
    ... but then testing of older people seems lower ...
    
    case rates 60 per 100,000 male & female
    
Factors associated with COVID-19-related death using OpenSAFELY
---------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19-related death was associated with: being male (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.53–1.65)); 
Black and South Asian people were at higher risk, even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48 (1.29–1.69) and 1.45 (1.32–1.58), 

90% of the COVID-19-related deaths in the UK have been in people over 60, and 60% in men


COVID-19 showed that the risk of death was higher for patients with cardiac, pulmonary and kidney disease, 
as well as cancer, dementia and obesity (HRs of 1.19–1.39 after correction for age and sex)6

 Increasing age was strongly associated with risk, with people aged 80 
 or over having a more than 20-fold-increased risk compared to 50–59-year-olds 
 (fully adjusted HR 20.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 18.70–22.68)
 

People from all BAME groups were at higher risk than those of white ethnicity. 
When adjusted only for age and sex, hazard ratios ranged from 1.62–1.88 for Black and South Asian individuals
and people of mixed ethnicities, compared to white people,


Increasing risks were seen with increasing obesity (fully adjusted HR 1.92 (1.72–2.13) for a body mass index 
(BMI; kg m−2) of over 40),

deprivation 1-5 (IMD) gives increase of 2x

We found a consistent pattern of increasing risk with greater deprivation, with the most deprived quintile having 
a hazard ratio of 1.79 compared to the least deprived, consistent with recent national statistics16. 
Again, very little of this increased risk was explained by pre-existing disease or clinical factors,
suggesting that other social factors have an important role.

Increasing risks were seen with increasing obesity (fully adjusted HR 1.92 (1.72–2.13) 
for a body mass index (BMI; kg m−2) of over 40)

Within the UK, ADHD is sometimes referred to as Hyperkinetic Disorder. ADHD affects about 3-5% of children and 2% of adults and is more common in males

Bipolar is a severe mental health condition characterised by significant mood swings including manic highs and depressive lows. The majority of individuals with bipolar experience alternating episodes of mania and depression. 1.3 million 
people in the UK have bipolar. That is one in fifty people
